I am a data scientist with an MSc from UCL and quantitative experience working as a mathematician. My education and work experience have given me a strong appreciation of the power of quantitative methods and mathematical models to understand complex situations. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to make a difference by solving challenging problems and helping to make better decisions.
