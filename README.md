I am a data scientist with an MSc from UCL and quantitative experience working as a mathematician. My education and work experience have given me a strong appreciation of the power of quantitative methods and mathematical models to understand complex situations. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to make a difference by solving challenging problems and helping to make better decisions.

Apart from my work experience and education, I have also worked on Kaggle competitions and created data visualisations to practice and build on my data science skills and knowledge.

* Finetuning LLMs to classify fake news: Developed classification models for detecting fake news using LLMs and traditional NLP (SVM with feature engineering). Found and cleaned large datasets with the Python library pandas. Finetuned LLMs (BERT and GPT-2) to build classification models, using pytorch and HuggingFace. Effectively worked in a team of four, with Google Colab. Collaboratively wrote a report presenting our methodology and results, and gave a short presentation highlighting our conclusions - [(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/376477624_Detecting_Machine-Generated_Fake_News_Comparing_Transformers_and_Linguistic_Feature_Analysis)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/376477624_Detecting_Machine-Generated_Fake_News_Comparing_Transformers_and_Linguistic_Feature_Analysis)
